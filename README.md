# Supply Chain Performance & Freight Cost Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory analysis of the **SCMS Delivery History Dataset**, focusing on shipment modes, lead times, on-time delivery, and freight cost efficiency.


## Executive Summary
Key insights:
- **Air freight dominates** shipments (>60%) and costs, showing strong reliance on speed but at a premium.
- **Air freight dominates** shipments (>60%) and costs, showing strong reliance on speed but at a premium.
- **Trucking is cost-efficient**, carrying ~30% of orders while contributing only 22% of costs.
- **Air Charter is expensive**, handling just 6.5% of shipments but 13% of costs, mostly for urgent cases.
- **On-time delivery varies by region and vendor**, with several areas showing frequent delays.
- **Freight cost per kilogram differs significantly by shipment mode and region**, pointing to optimization opportunities.

These findings highlight the trade-offs between speed, cost, and reliability in logistics operations.

## Key Analyses & Visuals



### 1. Shipment Mode â€“ Volume \& Cost Share

- Air accounts for over 60% of shipments, underlining its role as the primary mode.  

- Trucking follows with ~28%, essential for domestic and last-mile delivery.  

- Ocean freight remains limited at 3.7%.

### 2. Lead Time Analysis

- Countries differ significantly: Sierra Leone, Benin, Kazakhstan < 50 days, while Pakistan and Guatemala exceed 200â€“300 days.  

- Vendor performance also varies: S. Buys Wholesaler ~35 days, CIPLA Limited >140 days.  

- Shipment modes show clear contrasts: Ocean (~175 days) vs. Truck (~55 days).

### 3. On-time Delivery

- Trucking achieves higher reliability compared to air and ocean.  

- Certain vendors and regions show frequent delays.

### 4. Freight Cost per Kilogram
- Air and Air Charter are the most expensive.  
- Trucking is the cheapest.  
- Ocean lies in between, suitable for heavy but less urgent shipments.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

This analysis confirms clear trade-offs between **volume, cost, and timeliness**:  

- **Air freight** ensures speed but comes with high costs â†’ best for critical shipments.  

- **Trucking** is cost-efficient â†’ maximize for domestic/non-urgent deliveries.  

- **Air Charter** is disproportionately expensive â†’ keep for emergencies only.  

- **Ocean freight** could be expanded for bulk, low-priority orders.
  
**Recommendations:**  

1. Rebalance orders between **Air and Truck** to reduce costs.  

2. Improve **on-time performance** with stronger vendor coordination.  

3. Investigate **regional bottlenecks** behind delays.  

4. Increase **use of Ocean freight** where possible.
